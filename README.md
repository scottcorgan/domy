domy
====

A collection of small modules that make the DOM more peaceful.

This collection of modules is meant to used with [Browserify](http://browserify.org/). Each module is broken down into its own package to reduce the size of your client side javascript file.

Looking to continue adding modules to this list. Please contribute.
